# Sample Convertion of React Dashboard
This is a dashboard which was made for production use

Many features are missing in this sample version

Some of the code is copied from an active development, meaning this is a development version

The original Dashboard uses an express server to serve live data from Jenkins logs

The original Dashboard then fetches from this server to get the json data for constructing the grid
